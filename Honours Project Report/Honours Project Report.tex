\section{Abstract}
Shot Boundary Detection, or simply Shot Detection, is a fundamental part of research in the broader field of video processing, used for essential video analysis tasks such as 
video indexing and content-based video retrieval. For professional video game live streamers, who create hours of continuous content with significant downtime, identifying
cuts in their streams is an important first step for automatically generating condensed stream highlights. In this project, I have summarized the nomenclature and methodologies
established in the academic canon for Shot Detection research, implemented a sample of the most common approaches, Colour Histogram comparison and Edge Change Ratio using Canny 
Edge Detection, and compared their effectiveness when used on video game live stream content, as well as establishing methodological challenges to this new content form.
