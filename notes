canny edge detection
sift/serf 

user input cut thresholds/ automatic thresholds

research on pre-existing literature and opencv packages

two windows: one for canny edge detection, one for colour histogram, then view change in those to see when an appropriate time to cut would be

run experiments to validate threshold conjectures
