user input cut thresholds/ automatic thresholds

research on pre-existing literature and opencv packages

two windows: one for canny edge detection, one for colour histogram, then view change in those to see when an appropriate time to cut would be

run experiments to validate threshold conjectures

so far, MSE gives way too unpredictable numbers to be reliable. SSIM seems to be somewhat consistent for the edges with some issues,
but the results with the histograms are shaky.

SSIM + global threshold at 0.7 results for canny edge detection:
    fairly consistent when it comes to hard cuts of shots of different things, but gives lots of false positives 
    during camera movement or when theres lots of movement in many places in the shot. false negatives on cuts between 
    scenes of similar content. when cutting from title frame to real shot it is 100%
